## Requirements

- **Visual Studio 2019** (16.0 or later), **Visual Studio 2022**, or **Visual Studio 2026** — Community, Professional, or Enterprise edition
- **Windows**
- **.NET Framework 4.8**
- **.NET 8.0 Runtime** (for the StdioProxy component)

## Installation

1. Install the extension from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) or download the `.vsix` file from [Releases](https://github.com/dhq-boiler/Unofficial-VS-MCP/releases)
2. Restart Visual Studio
3. The MCP server starts automatically when Visual Studio launches

## Setup — Connecting with Claude Code

> **Note:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%` is not recognized in bash. You must specify the full absolute path (e.g. `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\...`).

**Option A** — CLI command:

```
claude mcp add vs-mcp -- "C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\VsMcp\bin\VsMcp.StdioProxy.exe"
```

**Option B** — Manual configuration (add to your MCP config JSON):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vs-mcp": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\VsMcp\\bin\\VsMcp.StdioProxy.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

## Architecture

The extension runs an HTTP-based MCP server inside Visual Studio. A lightweight StdioProxy bridges stdio-based MCP clients (like Claude Code) to the HTTP server, enabling seamless communication.

```
Claude Code  ──stdio──▶  StdioProxy  ──HTTP──▶  VS Extension
                          (relay)                (MCP server)
```

When Visual Studio is not running, the StdioProxy provides offline responses for basic protocol operations and returns cached tool definitions.

## Multiple VS Instances

VS MCP Server supports multiple Visual Studio instances running simultaneously. Each VS instance registers itself via a port file (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\VsMcp\server.<PID>.port`) containing its HTTP port and the currently open solution path.

### Instance Selection

StdioProxy selects which VS instance to connect to based on command-line arguments:

| Argument | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| *(none)* | Auto-detect — walks up from the current working directory to find `.sln` files and connects to the matching VS instance. Falls back to the most recently started VS instance if no `.sln` is found. |
| `--sln <path>` | Connects to the VS instance that has the specified solution open |
| `--pid <pid>` | Connects to the VS instance with the specified process ID |

### CWD-based Auto-Detection

When no `--sln` or `--pid` argument is provided, StdioProxy automatically discovers `.sln` files by walking up from the current working directory. This means that in most cases, **no explicit configuration is needed** — simply launching Claude Code from within a project directory is enough.

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| 1 `.sln` found | Automatically connects to the VS instance with that solution |
| Multiple `.sln` found, 1 open in VS | Connects to the matching VS instance |
| Multiple `.sln` found, multiple open in VS | Connects to the closest match (nearest to CWD) and includes a hint in the `initialize` response |
| Multiple `.sln` found, none open in VS | Falls back to default behavior and includes a hint prompting the user to choose |
| No `.sln` found | Falls back to the most recently started VS instance |

### Configuration Examples

**Single instance** (auto-detect, no extra config needed):

```
claude mcp add vs-mcp -- "C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\VsMcp\bin\VsMcp.StdioProxy.exe"
```

**Multiple instances** (explicit solution-based — useful when CWD auto-detection is not sufficient):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vs-mcp-frontend": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\VsMcp\\bin\\VsMcp.StdioProxy.exe",
      "args": ["--sln", "C:\\Projects\\Frontend\\Frontend.sln"]
    },
    "vs-mcp-backend": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\VsMcp\\bin\\VsMcp.StdioProxy.exe",
      "args": ["--sln", "C:\\Projects\\Backend\\Backend.sln"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Tool Filtering

Use the `--tools` argument to load only the tool categories you need. This reduces the number of tools exposed to the AI agent, which can improve token efficiency and response relevance.

| Preset | Categories |
|--------|------------|
| `core` | General, Solution, Project, Build, Editor, EditPreview, Output, Navigation, NuGet, SolutionExplorer, Test |
| `debug` | Debugger, Breakpoint, Watch, Thread, Process, Immediate, Module, Register, Exception, Memory, Parallel, Diagnostics, Console |
| `web` | Web |
| `ui` | UI |

**Examples:**

```
claude mcp add vs-mcp -- "C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\VsMcp\bin\VsMcp.StdioProxy.exe" --tools core,debug
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vs-mcp": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\VsMcp\\bin\\VsMcp.StdioProxy.exe",
      "args": ["--tools", "core,debug"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also specify individual category names (e.g. `--tools General,Build,Debugger`). Omitting `--tools` loads all tools.

### Reconnection

- If VS is restarted, StdioProxy automatically reconnects on the next `tools/call` request.
- Stale port files from crashed or closed VS instances are cleaned up automatically during discovery.

## Showcase: hands-off AI-driven dogfood

With `focus_guard_set enabled=true`, an AI agent can drive a full
build → debug → UI verification cycle in Visual Studio on one monitor
while the developer keeps a fullscreen application (e.g. a game) running
on another — no focus theft, no window flicker, no context switch.

Paired with **[jidodebugger](https://jidodebugger.dhq-boiler.dev/)**
— an upstream MCP server that sits above vs-mcp's desktop-app UIA
layer and supersedes it with WPF-native automation (bridge injection
into the debuggee, direct `ICommand` invocation, and
ViewModel-property waits via `wpf_bridge_inject` /
`wpf_invoke_command` / `wpf_wait_for`, on top of the raw UIA tools
vs-mcp already provides) — the loop becomes: vs-mcp launches the
debuggee under the focus guard, jidodebugger drives its UI over the
same MCP session, and neither side has to touch the foreground.

Recorded end-to-end run against a WPF debuggee (6 tool calls, zero
human interventions, zero foreground steals):

| # | Tool | Result | What the guard did |
|---|------|--------|--------------------|
| 1 | `debug_start` (vs-mcp) | Debugging started | VS restore *and* debuggee launch both stayed background — the user's foreground app was never activated |
| 2 | `wpf_bridge_inject` (jidodebugger) | payload attached | — |
| 3 | `wpf_invoke_command` LoadCommand (jidodebugger) | fired=true, awaitedAsync=true | — |
| 4 | `wpf_wait_for` viewModel appears (jidodebugger) | matchCount=5 (~3.9 s) | — |
| 5 | `wpf_invoke_command` OpenMemberByKeyCommand (jidodebugger) | fired=true, awaitedAsync=true | — |
| 6 | `wpf_wait_for` propertyNotNull (jidodebugger) | matched | — |

How it works under the hood, when the guard is on:

1. `LockSetForegroundWindow` denies foreign `SetForegroundWindow` calls
   during the debug-start window.
2. `SPI_SETFOREGROUNDLOCKTIMEOUT` is temporarily raised so the launched
   debuggee's own activation attempts are demoted to a taskbar flash.
3. If VS is minimized at the moment `debug_start` /
   `debug_start_without_debugging` / `debug_restart` is invoked, it is
   re-minimized (`SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE`) whenever it tries to auto-restore
   during the lock window.

The setting is off by default, so opt-in via `focus_guard_set` before an
autonomous session and turn it off again when you want normal VS focus
behavior back.

### Observability

When focus does slip through, you don't have to guess what took it. A
background auditor (started automatically) records every foreground
transition Windows fires — process name, window title, timestamp, and
whether the guard was on. Call `focus_guard_audit_read` right after any
perceived focus steal to see exactly which process / window pulled
foreground and when, and `focus_guard_audit_clear` to reset the buffer
before a new test scenario.

## Bundled Claude Code Skills

The VS Extension ships a small set of Claude Code skills that complement the MCP
tools. They are deployed automatically on extension startup to
`%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\`, so Claude Code picks them up without manual setup.

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `vs-ui-explore` | Autonomous UI crawl of a VS debuggee — drives the app via `ui_snapshot`, `ui_find_elements`, and the `ui_wait_*` primitives, then reports crashes, error dialogs, unreachable screens, and disabled-but-expected states. Trigger it with prompts like "crawl the UI and report bugs". |

Source files live under `src/VsMcp.Extension/Skills/`; edit them there and the
extension will redeploy the updated copy on next launch (it compares file
content and skips unchanged files).

## Extended additions

- `ui_window_*` — window list / info / find / click / keys for **any** debuggee window, not just the main one.
- `ui_menu_*` — detect, inspect, select and dismiss popup / context / Win32 menus.
- `standard_dialog_*` / `standard_file_dialog_*` — MessageBox, TaskDialog and Open / Save / Folder dialogs, driven by logical action or control ID instead of localized captions.
- `diagnostics_*` — persistent JSONL trace of the tools plus a ZIP export for bug reports.
- Details: `docs/extended/` (`10-CLAUDE-GUIDANCE-AND-SKILL.md`, `11-DIAGNOSTICS.md`).
